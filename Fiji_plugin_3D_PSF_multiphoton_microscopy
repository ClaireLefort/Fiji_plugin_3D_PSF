Welcome to the Fiji_plugin_3D_PSF_multiphoton_microscopy!

In biomedical microscopy, nonlinear microscopy methods tend to replace classical ones working in the visible range. Multiphoton microscopy is the most popular nonlinear method. However, its resolution remains worst than standard confocal methods mainly due to the shifting of excitation wavelengths in NIR. In this context, the evaluation of resolution of multiphoton microscopes remains difficult due to the lack of existing adapted tools.

Here, we propose a plugin of ImageJ (or Fiji) for estimating 3D PSFs of images generated by multiphoton microscopes. This method is based on a variational approach for PSF modeling through multivariate Gaussian fitting, adapted to images highly damaged.
